# Advertising-campaign-analysis
Dataset has 41188 lines and 21 columns describing the results of the bank's marketing campaigns. The campaign is mainly based on  call directly to suggest customers for opening an saving account. If the customer agrees, the target variable is marked as "Yes", on the contrary, "No".

Objectives of the study:
- Analysis and visualization of data
- Point out insights and recommend actions
- Build customer's decision prediction model

In this project, my work is to analyze, visualize data, find insights, make recommendations and write report.
